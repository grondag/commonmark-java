MC Markdown
===============

This is a stipped down and modified fork of the [Commonmark library](https://github.com/atlassian/commonmark-java) for use in Minecraft mods.  It has crude methods for parsing and rendering a subset of markdown in-game. 

The code is not great and don't expect much by way of documentation. I made this because I needed it. I would love to replace it with someone else's code that got more love.
